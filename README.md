The **Stock Analysis** application is a Python-based tool that leverages the `yahooquery` package to fetch real-time stock data. The frontend is built using `Tkinter`, allowing users to analyze financial ratios and view visual representations of key financial statement line items through bar and trend charts.

### Purpose
This application provides users with ratio analysis and visualize data from financial statements in a user-friendly manner. The ratios focused on in this application includes: PE, Return on Equity and Debt to equity ratios. Furthermore, the Profit margin, EPS are also displayed. 
The application helps you visualize the financial health of a company by displaying charts in the following areas:
- Free Cash Flow (from the Cash Flow statement)
- Cash to Earnings (from the Cash Flow statement)
- Long Term Debt (from the Balance Sheet)
- Net Income (from the Income Statement)

Additionally, it provides a trend analysis comparing Cash from Operations and Net Income, supporting [cash-based earnings quality analysis](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/qualityofearnings.asp).
